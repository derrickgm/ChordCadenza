<h1>AudioSync Configuration Window</h1>

<p>This is used to configure and manage the audio synchronisation function.</p>
<p>An introduction to this function can be found <a href="HowTo_ChooseSyncAudio.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>AudioSync Configuration Window</b> allows you to manage the synchronisation data. This consists of two tracks: the <b>Record Track</b> and the <b>Play Track</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>Record Track</b> is created when you sync an <b>AudioFile</b> using the <b>Sync Audio</b> <i>Button</i> on the <b>ChordMap</b> or <b>TrackMap</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>Play Track</b> controls the current cursor when playing an <b>AudioFile</b>. This is located in the <span>Project</span> directory with the file extension .chtc.</p>
<p>The <b>Record Track</b> is copied to, or merged with, the <b>Play Track</b> from the <b>AudioSync Configuration Window</b>.</p>
<p>Extension .chtc saves byte offset values for an <b>AudioFile</b>.</p>
<p>Other controls in this window allow you to manage the synchronisation data and AudioFile position.</p>
