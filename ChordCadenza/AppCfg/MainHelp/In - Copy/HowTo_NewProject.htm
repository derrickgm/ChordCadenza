<h2>How To Create a New <b>Project</b></h2>

<p>A <b>Project</b> is a collection of files associated with a particular piece of music. These are located in a <b>Project</b> folder.</p>

<p> You can create a new <b>Project</b> using the <b>PlayMap > New Project <i>Button</i></b> or <b>PlayMap Menu > File > New Project</b>. This will display the <a href="Form_NewProject_Intro.htm">New Project Window</a>.</p>

<p>This will allow you to create and load a <span>Project</span> folder. You can also optionally copy a <b>MidiFile</b> (to create chords from, or to play along to) and an <b>AudioFile</b> (to play along to) into the <span>Project</span> folder.</p>

<p>Once the <span>Project</span> folder has been created, you can use the functions of this program to create a <b>ChordFile</b>, an <b>AudioSyncFile</b>, and a <b>LyricsFile</b>.</p>
