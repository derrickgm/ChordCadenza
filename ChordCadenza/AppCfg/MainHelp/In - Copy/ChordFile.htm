<h2>The <b>Chord File</b></h2>

  <p>The <b>ChordFile</b> is a text file that contains the chords that have been generated or inserted for a particular song. It can also contain data relating to keys, time signatures, and various other parameters. It is located in the <span>Project</span> path, and has an extension of <b>.chp</b>.</p>
  
  <p>Chords are created using the <A HREF="Form_ChordMap_Intro.htm">ChordMap</A>, and can be saved from there or from the <A HREF="Form_PlayMap_Intro.htm">PlayMap</A> or <A HREF="Form_TrackMap_Intro.htm">TrackMap</A>.</p>
  
  <p>The file can be edited with a text editor, but this is generally not recommended.</p>
  
  <p>It is the only file that should always be present in order to play a song with this application, unless you want to create the chords from scratch every time you intend to play something!</p>
