<h2>How To Improvise a Melody along with a <b>MidiFile</b></h2>
<p>The main idea here is to improvise a melody using the chords generated (or inputted) into this application.</p>

<p>The <b>PlayMap</b> makes this easier by displaying the chords, with note names or sol-fa notation, in a horizontal Midi Keyboard display. With practice, you can improve your improvisation skills by playing the chord notes and passing notes in different ways.</p>

<p>If you haven't already done so, load a <span>Project</span> containing a <b>MidiFile</b> and a <b>ChordFile</b></p>

<p>(See <a href="HowTo_GenerateChords.htm">How to Generate Chords from a <b>MidiFile</b></a> or <a href="HowTo_InsertChords.htm">How To Insert Keys and Chords from An External Source</a> to find out how to create a <b>ChordFile</b>.)</p>

<h3>Open The PlayMap</h3>
<p>The <b>PlayMap</b> shows the current position in the <b>MidiFile</b> in a display that shows the generated chords rolling downwards as the music progresses. This makes it easier to improvise and play along with the <b>MidiFile</b>.</p>

<p>If possible, you should try to locate your keyboard below your computer screen, and resize the <b>PlayMap</b> so that your keyboard keys match the <b>PlayMap</b> display.</p>

<h3>Select a Play Mode</h3>
<p>There are two play modes available <b>KeyboardMode</b>  and <b>ChordMode</b> .</p>

<p>These can be selected using the option buttons on the left-hand side of the <b>PlayMap,</b>  or from a <b>SwitchKey</b>.</p> 

<p>In both cases, the <b>PlayMap</b> will display the notes matching the pitches that will be played by the appropriate key on the Midi keyboard.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Mode</h3>
<p>With <b>Keyboard Mode,</b> the normal pitch from the Midi keyboard (subject to any transposition or octave shifting that you may have set) will be played. This gives you the freedom to play any notes, using the <b>PlayMap</b> as a guide.</p>

<p>Notes of the scale of the current key are shown on the bottom line. Chord notes are shown in a different colour on the lines above.</p>

<h3>Chord Mode</h3>
<p>With <b>ChordMode,</b> only the notes of the current chord on the white keys are played. This is easier to play, but does not allow non-chord notes to be played</p>
