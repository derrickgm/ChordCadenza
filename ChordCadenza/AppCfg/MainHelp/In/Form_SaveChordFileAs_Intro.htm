<h1>Save ChordFile As... Window</h1>

<p>This window is displayed whenever you click the <b>Save As</b> <i>Button</i> on the <b>ChordMap</b>.</p>

<p>It allows you to choose the number (0 - 9) to append to the .chp extension of the <b>ChordFile</b> name. This will let you choose from a collection of <b>ChordFiles</b> whenever you load a <span>Project</span>.  You can use this to save <b>ChordFiles</b> that have been created in different ways (e.g. by using different selected tracks, different time divisions, or copied from sheet music.)</p>
