<h2>How To Generate Keys from a MidiFile</h2>

<p>If you haven't already done so, load a <span>Project</span></p> 

<p>This should contain at least a <b>MidiFile</b> (*.mid) of the piece of music you want to generate the keys for.</p>

<p>This should open the <b>TrackMap</b> window.</p>

<h3>Select which tracks you want to use to calculate the keys using the <b>TrackMap</b> Window.</h3>
<p>It's usually OK to select all tracks, using the <b>Check All</b> <i>Button</i> at the top of the <b>TrackMap</b> window.</p> 

<p>Any percussion tracks or notes that have had pitchbend applied will be ignored by <b>CalcKeys</b> .</p>

<h3>Click the "Calc Keys" <i>Button</i> on the TrackMap</h3>
<p>This will bring up the <b>CalcKeys</b> window, which contains a table of calculated keys for each bar.</p>

<p>There are a number of options on here for fine tuning how the keys are calculated. However, the default options work very well for most midifiles.</p>

<p>The column labelled with an <b>Inertia</b> of '90' will be used by default, and is usually the most accurate. You can select another inertia by using the <b>Inertia</b> option buttons.</p>
<p>(Note: the higher the inertia, the less frequently the key is likely to change.)</p>

<h3>Generate the Keys</h3>
<p>Click the <b>Apply</b> or <b>Apply and Close</b> <i>Button</i> to generate the keys (and close the window).</p>
