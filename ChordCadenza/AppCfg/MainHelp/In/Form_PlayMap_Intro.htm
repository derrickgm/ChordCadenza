<h1>The PlayMap</h1>
  <p>The <b>PlayMap</b> is the first screen you should see after starting the application.</p>
  <p>Closing the <b>PlayMap</b> will close the application.</p>
  <p>The top part of the <b>PlayMap</b> contains the menu, command buttons, and various options.</p>
  <p>The main panel below this shows the chord notes, spread across a keyboard. The keyboard can be configured to be 1 - 4 octaves long</p>
  <p>Resizing the <b>PlayMap</b> window horizontally does not change the number of octaves displayed, but can be used to match the scale of a real midi keyboard.</p>
  <p>You can also resize the <b>PlayMap</b> window vertically. This will allow more or less chords to be displayed. The bottom line of chords represent the current position, with lines above representing later chords.</p>
  <p>The bottom panel shows the current major or minor key scale notes. </p>
  <p>The left-hand panel show bar numbers, and the right-hand panel shows chord names.</p>
  <p>The chord notes are updated as a <b>MidiFile</b> (or <b>AudioFile</b>) is played. Each time a beat is reached, the notes move down.</p>
