<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>Windows Vista SP1, windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10</p>
<p>.Net 4.0 (installed by default on Windows 8 and later. May require a Microsoft Update for Windows Vista SP1 and Windows 7. The application will check this when first run.)</p>
<p>Audio output hardware (sound card, speakers or headphones)</p>
<p>Access to some MidiFiles. (If you haven't got any MidiFiles, there are many thousands available on the internet. Just do a search for MidiFiles.)</p>
<p>A Midi keyboard is recommended, but not essential.</p>  

<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Run the <b>Setup ChordCadenza.exe</b> file. If a previous version of Chord Cadenza is already installed, a warning message will be displayed before removing it. The option to install the starter soundfont file should be checked, unless you are going to be using an external synthesizer to convert midi to audio, or you already have a soundfont installed.</p>
