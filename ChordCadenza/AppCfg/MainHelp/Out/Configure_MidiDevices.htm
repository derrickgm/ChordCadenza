<h2>Configure Midi Devices</h2>
<p>This is used to configure Midi Input and Output devices</p>

<p>
  There are three devices that can be configured here:
  <ul>
    <li>Midi Keyboard (input)</li>
    <li>Sequencer Stream (output)</li>
    <li>Midi Keyboard (output)</li>
  </ul>
</p>  

<p>The Midi Keyboard input device should be set to your midi keyboard</p>

<p>The output devices can be set to a Midi Synthesizer that is external to this application, or to the Built_In synthesizer that is provided by this application.</p>

<p>If you set the output devices to the same external synthesizer, you will have to ensure that any midi keyboard output is set to a midi channel not used by the output stream. If you set the output devices to the built-in synthesizer, they will use different ports, so all channels can be used on both devices.</p>

<p>The synth packaged with Windows (Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth or similar) is not recommended. This is poor quality, and introduces a latency (delay) that will be noticeable even if the sound card delay is small.</p>

<p>If you use the Built_In Synth, and the audiocard is connected, a panel will be displayed to allow the soundfont, volume, tuning and FX effects to be set.</p> 

<p>The soundfont dropdown list shows all the soundfont files found in the soundfonts path. The list can be changed using <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Paths > SoundFonts</b>. You will need to redisplay the Midi Config window for the update to take effect.</p>

<p>The selected soundfont will be loaded on Connect/Reconnect. If there are no soundfont files found, you will be prompted to select a new soundfonts path.</p>

<p>Changes will be actioned after the Connect/Reconnect button is clicked, and will be saved using the <b>PlayMap Menu > File > Save Settings</b>, or clicking <b>Save Settings and Exit Program</b> option when exiting the application.</p>

<p>A description of the controls used in the Midi Devices Configuration Window can be found <a href="Form_MidiDevs_Ctls.htm">here</a>.</p>
