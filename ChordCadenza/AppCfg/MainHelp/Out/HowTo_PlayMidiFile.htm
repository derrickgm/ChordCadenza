<h2>How To Play a <b>MidiFile</b></h2>

<p>If you haven't already done so, load a <span>Project</span> containing a <b>MidiFile</b> and a <b>ChordFile</b></p>

<h3>Open A Playable Window</h3>
<p>You can play a <b>MidiFile</b> from either the <b>PlayMap</b> window, the <b>TrackMap</b> window, or the <b>ChordMap</b> window.</p>

<p>All of these windows have buttons to start, stop, and pause play, and they all keep track of the current play position.</p>

<h3>The TrackMap</h3>
<p>This shows the notes of each track of the <b>MidiFile</b>. You can mute and solo tracks from here, adjust the volume and panning of any track, and change the patch (instrument) of any track.</p>

<p>Any changes made here can be saved in the <b>ChordFile</b> (.chp).</p>

<h3>The PlayMap</h3>
<p>This is where you would normally play along to the <b>MidiFile</b> using your midi or PC keyboard. It shows the current position in the <b>MidiFile</b> in a display that shows the generated chords rolling downwards as the music progresses.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to improvise and play along with the <b>MidiFile</b> - see <b>HowTo Play a melody along with a <b>MidiFile</b> and <b>HowTo play chords along with a <b>MidiFile</b>.</b> </p>
