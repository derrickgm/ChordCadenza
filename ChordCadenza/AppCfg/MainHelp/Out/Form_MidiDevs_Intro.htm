<h1>Midi Devices Configuration</h1>

<p>This is used to configure the midi devices (ports) used by this application.</p>

<p>
  There are three devices that can be configured here:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Midi Keyboard Input</b></li>
    <li><b>Sequencer Stream Output</b></li>
    <li><b>Midi Keyboard Output</b></li>
  </ul>
</p>  

<p>The <b>Midi Keyboard Input</b> should be set to your midi keyboard. If you don't have a Midi keyboard, you should leave this disconnected to allow the PC keyboard to be used instead.</p>

<p>The output devices can be set to a midi synthesizer that is external to this application, or to the <b>BuiltIn Synth</b> that is provided by this application.</p>

<p>If you set the output devices to the same external synthesizer, you will have to ensure that the <b>Midi Keyboard Output</b> is set to a midi channel not used by the <b>Sequencer Stream Output</b>. If you set the output devices to the BuiltIn synthesizer, they will use different ports, so all channels can be used on both devices.</p>

<p>The synth packaged with Windows (Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth or similar) is not recommended. This is poor quality, and introduces a latency (delay) that will be noticeable even if the sound card delay is small.</p>

<p>If you use the <b>BuiltIn Synth</b>, and the audiocard is connected, a panel will be displayed to allow the soundfont, volume, tuning and FX effects to be set.</p> 

<p>The <b>Soundfont DropdownList</b> shows all the soundfont files found in the soundfonts path. The list can be changed using <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Paths > SoundFonts</b>. You will need to redisplay the <b>Midi Devices Configuration</b> window for the update to take effect.</p>

<p>The selected soundfont will be loaded when the <b>Connect</b> Button is clicked. If there are no soundfont files found, you will be prompted to select a new soundfonts path.</p>

<p>Changes will be actioned after one of the the <b>Connect</b> or <b>Disconnect</b> <i><i>Buttons</i></i> are clicked, and will be saved using the <b>PlayMap Menu > File > Save Settings</b>, or clicking <b>Save Settings and Exit Program</b> option when exiting the application.</p>

<p>A description of the controls used in the Midi Devices Configuration Window can be found <a href="Form_MidiDevs_Ctls.htm">here</a>.</p>
