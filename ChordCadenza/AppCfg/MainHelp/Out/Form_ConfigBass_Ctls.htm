<h3>Audio Configuration Components</h3>

<h3>Current Connection Display</h3>
<p>Shows the audio device that is currently connected.</p>
<p>This will be used by any midi output ports set to <b>BuiltIn Synth</b>, and by the <b>AudioFile</b> player.</p>
<p>It may or may not be the same as the selected device in the dropdown box.</p>

<h3>Audio Output Selection</h3>
<p>Selected audio output device.</p>
<p>Use this to select a new device. You may need to click the <b>Disconnect</b> Button before selecting a new device.</p>
<p>When selected, the <b>Device Characteristics</b> fields should be updated.</p>
<p>Click the <b>Connect</b> <i>Button</i> to make the device the current connection.</p>

<h3>Asio <i>CheckBox</i></h3>
<p>Use <span>ASIO</span> driver.</p>
<p>Check if you have an <span>ASIO</span> soundcard or third party driver.</p>

<h3>ASIO Panel <i>Button</i></h3>
<p>Show <span>ASIO</span> Control Panel (as supplied by the <span>ASIO</span> driver)</p>

<h3>ASIO dB Level <i>Slider</i></h3>
<p>Apply volume adjustment to ASIO volume level.</p>
<p>Volume is attenuated (left of midpoint), or amplified (right of midpoint)</p>

<h3>Connect Audio Only <i>Button</i></h3>
<p>Connect the audio device selected on the <b>Audio Output DropdownList</b>.</p>
<p>If you want to use any <b>BuiltIn Synthesizer</b> Midi ports, these will need to be connected using the <a href="Form_MidiDevs_Intro.htm">Midi Devices Configuration Window</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click the <b>Connect Audio & BuiltIn MidiOut</b> <i>Button</i> to connect any <b>BuiltIn Synthesizer</b> Midi ports.</p>

<h3>Connect Audio & BuiltIn MidiOut <i>Button</i></h3>
<p>Connect the audio device selected on the <b>Audio Output DropdownList</b>.</p>
<p>This will also connect any <b>BuiltIn Synthesizer</b> Midi ports.</p>

<h3>Disconnect Audio & BuiltIn MidiOut <i>Button</i></h3>
<p>Disconnect the audio device selected in the <b>Audio Output DropdownList.</b></p>
<p>You may need to click this before selecting a new device.</p>
<p>This may be useful if you want to start another audio application that needs exclusive access to a soundcard.</p>
<p>This will also disconnect any <b>BuiltIn Synthesizer</b> Midi ports.</p>

<h3>Latency <i>Display</i></h3>
<p>Shows the delay (in milliseconds) between sending an audio signal, and hearing it, as estimated from the soundcard.</p>

<h3>Min Buffer <i>Display</i></h3>
<p>Shows the minimum buffer size (in milliseconds) required, as reported from the soundcard.</p>

<h3>Buffer Size <i>Numeric Control</i></h3>
<p>Set the Buffer Size (in milliseconds) that will be used when the soundcard is connected.</p>
<p>Decreasing this should decrease the latency, but with the risk of sound distortion or drop-outs.</p>
<p>Values should be in the range 11 to 5000 milliseconds.</p>

<h3>Update Period <i>Numeric Control</i></h3>
<p>Set the Update Period in milliseconds.</p>
<p>This will be sent to the soundcard when connected.</p>
<p>You may need to lower this to support a smaller buffer size, but this will use more CPU.</p>
<p>Values should be in the range 5 to 100 milliseconds.</p>

<h3>Calc From Update Period <i>Button</i></h3>
<p>Calculate the <b>Buffer Size</b> from the <b>Update Period</b>.</p>
<p>This is done using a simple formula to calculate a minmum buffersize, using the device's <b>Min Buffer</b> setting.</p>
<p>It is not guaranteed to give a satisfactory result, but can act as a starting point for further experimentation.</p>

<h3>MidiPlay Delay <i>Numeric Control</i></h3>
<p>Set a delay (in milliseconds) before updating the play cursor whilst playing a midifile.</p>
<p>This can be useful if the audio driver has a significant latency.</p>
<p>The default is zero, meaning the play cursor will be updated as soon as the bar or beat in the midifile is reached.</p>
<p>Any changes have immediate effect - there is no need to reconnect the device.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Delay <i>Numeric Control</i></h3>
<p>Set the delay before moving on to the next chord in the <b>ChordMap</b>.</p>
<p>This will be added to the syncopation time, which is set from the <b>PlayMap</b>.</p>
<p>Any changes have immediate effect - there is no need to reconnect the device.</p>

<h3>Set From Device (MidiPlay Delay) <i>Button</i></h3> 
<p>Set the MidiPlay Delay to the latency from the audio device driver.</p>
<p>If the latency is low (less than 50 ms), it is not normally necessary to set this.</p>

<h3>Switch Off (MidiPlay Delay) <i>Button</i></h3> 
<p>Set the MidiPlay Delay to zero.</p>

<h3>Set From Device (Keyboard Delay) <i>Button</i></h3> 
<p>Set the Midi Keyboard Delay to the latency from the audio device driver.</p>
<p>If the latency is low (less than 50 ms), it is not normally necessary to set this.</p>

<h3>Switch Off (Keyboard Delay) <i>Button</i></h3> 
<p>Set the Midi Keyboard Delay to zero.</p>
