<h2>How To Play using the PC Keyboard</h2>

<p>If you don't have a Midi keyboard, you can still play notes and chords using the PC Keyboard. This is not meant as a replacement for a Midi keyboard, but you can do most of the things that a Midi keyboard can do.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The default keyboard mapping should work with standard UK and US keyboards. It defines a 2 octave range, using only alphanumeric keys. If you have a different type of keyboard, or want to map to different keys, you can select the <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > PCKB Keys</b> to set up to 4 octaves. Most keys can be mapped, with the exception of the 'Print Screen' and 'Windows Logo' keys.</p>

<p>If the <b>Play Notes per Chord (PC KB)</b> <i>CheckBox</i> in the <b>Miscellaneous Configurations</b> Window is checked, this will allow you to play chords with a single key press. This is usually better than trying to play a chord with multiple key presses on a PC keyboard.</p>

<p>If you are using any special keys (e.g. Shift, Control, Alt, Caps Lock), then any options involving 'Sticky Keys', 'Toggle Keys', or 'Filter Keys' should be turned off in the Windows Control Panel or Settings. (On Windows 10, these are located in the Control Panel > Ease of Access Center).</p> 

<h3>Using the PC Keyboard</h3>
<p>By default, the PC keyboard will be active if there is no Midi In device connected. You can change this by clicking <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Miscellaneous</b>, and checking the <b>Disable PCKB</b> Checkbox.

<p>Pressing a key will switch a note on, letting go switches it off. You can press more than one key at a time, however there is a limit to the number of simultaneous key presses that will be recognised by the system. This depends on which combination of keys are pressed and the internal wiring of the keyboard. You can often play 4 keys simultaneously.</p>

<p>If the PC keyboard is active and a <span>Project</span> is loaded, the bottom line of the <b>PlayMap</b> display will show the alphanumeric character corresponding to the diatonic notes of the current musical key. If the <b>PCKBChar</b> <i>CheckBox</i> in the <b>Note Display</b> panel in the <b>PlayMap.</b> is also checked, the notes on the main display will also show the PC keyboard alphanumeric characters.</p>

<p>The bottom note (C) of the bottom octave should always align to the bottom note of the <b>PlayMap</b> display (unless the keybord is transposed). SwitchKeys are mapped to the function keys on the PC keyboard. Each of the 12 function keys are mapped to the corresponding midi SwitchKey (F1=C, F2=C# ... F12=Bb). You can define SwitchKeys to increase or decrease the keyboard velocity using <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Switch Keys</b>. You can also adjust the velocity with the mouse wheel, provided the mouse pointer is located over the main panel on the <b>PlayMap</b>. (You don't need to click the mouse first.) </p>

<h3>Comparison with Midi Keyboard</h3>
<p>The PC keyboard should be as responsive as a Midi keyboard. The main differences are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The keyboard velocity has to be set to a constant value - you can't make a note louder by hitting the keyboard harder!</li>
  <li>There is a limit to the number of keys you can play simultaneously.</li>
  <li>There is no sustain pedal or switch on a PC keyboard. However, you can set a <b>SwitchKkey</b> to perform sustain, using <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Switch Keys</b></li>
  <li>There is no mod wheel or pitch wheel on a PC keyboard.</li>
  <li>It's more difficult to work out where the notes are on a PC keyboard. A Midi keyboard is always going to feel more natural.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Using the Mouse</h3>
<p>You can also play notes by clicking with the mouse on the main panel of the <b>PlayMap</b>. You can only play single keystrokes this way, and it is less responsive than the Midi or PC keyboards.</p>
