<h2>The <b>Midi File</b></h2>

<p>This is a standard file that represents the musical events in a piece of music. The filename usually has an extension of <b>.mid</b>. It can be used to play a piece of music on midi instruments.</p>

<p>This program uses <b>MidiFiles</b> to play a piece of music, and to allow the chords to be generated algorithmically. A <b>MidiFile</b> is usualy present in the <span>Project</span> folder, along with a <b>ChordFile</b> and sometimes some other files.</p>

<p>There are a large number of these files available on the internet. A google search for "midi files" will return many sites listing thousands of <b>MidiFiles</b>.</p>
