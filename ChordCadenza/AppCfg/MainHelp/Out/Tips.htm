<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>Here are some guidelines on how to get the most out of this application.</p>

<p>If you only want to play chords, use <b>ChordMode</b>. If you want to play mainly chords, but with the option toplay the odd non-chord note, use <b>Keyboard Mode</b> with the <b>KBChord</b> switch key.</p>

<p>Chords can sound better with the sustain pedal, using the <b>Note On/Off</b> sustain option.</p>

<p>If you are inputting chords from sheet music, try to make sure you get the time signatures right before inputting a chord. You can add a new time signature as it occurs in the music, just before inputting a chord for that bar. If you have to change any time signatures later on, you may have to do some extra work to align chords, keys, lyrics etc. to the new bars.</p>

<p>Many MidiFiles only contain very basic modulations. Some leave the key as C major, even if the song is clearly in another key. Use <b>CalcKeys</b> to get a more accurate idea of the keys - this will also lead to more accurate chord generations.</p>

<p>The <b>Syncopation</b> time interval is an important part of the 
chord playing experience. A value of 1/16 seems to work for most songs, but a heavily syncopated song might require a longer interval (e.g. 3/32 or 1/8). It may also vary depending on your playing technique and keyboard latency. Once you have a value that works well, you will get to know when the 'right' time is to play a new chord in a song.</p>
