<h1>Miscellaneous Configurations - Timers</h1>

<p>These are all <i>Numeric Inputs</i></p>

<h3>Sustain</h3>
<p>The time (in milliseconds) to wait for notes to be considered to be part of the same chord.</p>
<p>This is used by the emulated sustain functions - see <a href="Sustain.htm">Sustain Types</a>.</p>

<h3>Stream Resolution</h3>
<p>This is the resolution used to play Midi events from a midifile. It is expressed as a number of milliseconds.</p>
<p>Increasing it will use less computer memory and CPU. A decrease will make the midi playing more accurate.</p>
<p>The recommended value is 5.</p>
<p>A Project reload is required to effect any change in this value.</p>

<h3>Syncopation</h3>
<p>The time interval before the actual chord time when the chord becomes active during playing.</p>
<p>This is to allow the chord to be played just before a beat or bar, and also allows for any keyboard latencies.</p>
<p>The time is expressed as a fraction of a midi note. The default value is 1/16. Heavily syncopated music may require more syncopation (e.g. 1/8).</p>
<p>This value is saved in the application ini file (ChordCadenza.ini). It is the default used if not overriden by the <b>ChordFile</b>.</p>
