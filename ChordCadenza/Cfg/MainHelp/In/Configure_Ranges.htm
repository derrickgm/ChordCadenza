<h1>Configuring Keyboard Ranges</h2>

<p>The <b>Keyboard Ranges Window</b> is used to configure your midi keyboard. It is opened from <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Midi Keyboard Ranges</b>.</p>

<p>It allows you to set the lowest key present on your midi keyboard, and the lowest key that you want to be displayed.</p>

<p>It is important to do this in order for the keyboard keys that you play to be within the range of the <a href="Form_PlayMap_Intro.htm">PlayMap</a>.</p>

<p>It also matters if you want the bottom octave of the midi keyboard to be used for <a href="Form_SwitchKeys_Intro.htm"><b>SwitchKeys</b></a>.</p>
