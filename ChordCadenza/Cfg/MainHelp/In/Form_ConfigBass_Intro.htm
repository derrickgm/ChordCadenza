<h1>Audio Configuration Window</h1>

<p>This is used to configure the application's audio device.</p> 

<p>It only needs to be configured if you are going to use the <b>BuiltIn Synth</b> or <b>Play AudioFile</b> functions of this program. All audio output is mixed down to one stereo channel, which is output to whatever audio device has been configured.</p>

<p>The top line Shows the current connection, if there is one.</p>

<p>Below that, there is a dropdown list showing available soundcard drivers on your system. You should select whatever device you intend to use, after clicking the <b>Disconnect Audio & BuiltIn MidiOut</b> <i>Button</i> if necessary.</p> 

<p>The <i>CheckBox</i> below that is to set <span>ASIO</span> on or off. <span>ASIO</span> is a sound card driver specified by Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH. It is generally supported on high-end sound cards, and provides low latency. This is important for real time music applications like this, as you generally want to minimize any delays between playing a note and actually hearing it. If you are only going to use the soundcard for playing audio files, it doesn't really matter if you use ASIO or not.</p>

<p>If your soundcard does not support <span>ASIO</span>, you should leave the box unchecked, or download an <span>ASIO</span> driver. ASIO4All by Michael Tippach is an excellent driver that appears to work with most soundcards.</p>

<p>The general idea is that you should minimize the latency, but without distorting the sound output. If the latency is too low, you will get sound dropouts or no sound at all. If the latency is too high, there will be a discernable delay between playing a note on the midi keyboard, and actually hearing it.</p>

<p>Audio settings can be changed only when the soundcard is disconnected using the <b>Disconnect Audio & BuiltIn MidiOut</b> <i>Button</i>. 

<h3>Configuring ASIO Drivers</h3>
<p>If the <b>ASIO <i>CheckBox</i></b> is checked, you should see a list of <span>ASIO</span> devices in the <b>Audio Output DropdownBox.</b> Select the device that you want to output to.</p>

<p> Clicking the <b>ASIO Panel <i>Button</i></b> should show the ASIO control panel from the ASIO driver. If the device is not connected, you should be able to adjust the settings on the ASIO panel and reconnect.</p>

<p>You should try to find the lowest latency time that does not cause distortion of the sound. Any settings will be saved with all of the other settings in the ChordCadenza.ini file.</p>

<h3>Configuring Non-ASIO Drivers</h3>

<p>If the <b>ASIO <i>CheckBox</i></b> is unchecked, you should see a list of non-ASIO devices in the <b>Audio Output DropdownBox.</b> Select the device that you want to output to.</p>

<p>There should be a panel in the bottom left quadrant of the window showing <b>Device Characteristics and Device Variables</b>.

<p>The <b>Device Characteristics</b> panel shows the latency and minimum buffer size, as reported from the sound card selected in the <b>Audio Output DropdownBox</b>. If you update the <b>Set Device Variable</b> fields, and click one of the <b>Connect <i>Buttons</i></b>, this will activate the sound card with the new settings. You should be able to try out the audio card (assuming you have set a midi port to <b>BuiltIn Synth</b> on the <A HREF="Configure_MidiDevices.htm">Midi Devices Configuration Window</A>).</p>

<p>Adjusting these parameters is somewhat hit and miss. If the sound is distorted or silent, you should increase the <b>Buffer Size</b>. If you are experiencing high latency (delay between playing a pitch and hearing it), you can try decreasing the <b>Buffer Size</b>. The smaller the buffer is, the shorter the <b>Update Period</b> should be.</p>

<p>Once you have found some values that work, don't forget to save the settings using <b>PlayMap Menu > File > Save Settings</b>, or click <b>Save Settings and Exit Program</b> option when exiting the application.</p>
