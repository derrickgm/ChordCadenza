<h2>How To Create a Velocity or Aftertouch Profile using a Bezier Curve</h2>
<p>A Bezier Curve is an intuitive way of drawing a curve between two points. This is used in this application to draw a keyboard velocity profile or an aftertouch profile. If yout midi keyboard does not support key velocity or aftertouch, or you key velocity is set to a constant value, the Bezier Curve will not be of any use.</p>
<p>The diagrams below show examples of velocity profiles that could be used.</p>

<img src="Bezier04.jpg" alt="Velocity profile with More Sensitivity in Middle" style="width:350px;height:350px;">

<p>The curve on the left show the default velocity profile, where the output velocity is the same as the input velocity.</p>
<p>The curve on the right shows a velocity profile with more sensitivity in the middle.</p>

<h3>Drawing a Velocity Bezier Curve</h3>
<p>First, display the Velocity Bezier Curve by selecting <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Bezier > Velocity</b>.</p>

<p>Then, click on the red circles and drag the mouse to move the spline (straight line) around. This will change the shape of the curve. With a little practice, you can change the curve in almost any way.</p>

<p>You can restore the default at any time with the <i>Button</i> at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>The curve will be saved with the rest of the application settings.</p>  

<h3>Drawing an Aftertouch Bezier Curve</h3>
<p>If your keyboard has Aftertouch, you can create an Aftertouch profile using <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Bezier > Aftertouch,</b> using the same method.</p>
