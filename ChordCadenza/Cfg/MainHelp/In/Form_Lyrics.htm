<h1>Lyrics Editor</h1>

<p>This is used to edit any lyrics associated with a project. Simple text editing functions are provided for changing, inserting, or deleting lyrics lines. One lyrics line corresponds to one bar of music.</p>

<p>Lyrics can be useful for locating a place in the music, especially when synchronising to an audio file. They can also be used to locate cue points in the music (e.g. the start of a solo instrument).</p>

<p>Changes are only updated on the <b>ChordMap</b>, <b>TrackMap</b>, and <b>PlayMap</b> when the <b>Update</b> <i>Button</i> is clicked. Saving the project will save the current lyrics as displayed on these Maps as a file ending with the extension <b>.chl</b>.</p>

<p>Updates can be undone or redone using the <b>Undo Update</b> and <b>Redo Update</b> <i>Buttons</i>. Any changes made before using the <b>Update</b> <i>Button</i> cannot be undone until after the <b>Update</b> <i>Button</i> is clicked.</p>

<p>It is advisable to make sure the time signature(s) are correct before entering lyrics. If any time signatures are changed, the lyrics will probably become out of sync with the new bars, and will need to be edited.</p>

<p>If lines are inserted with the editor, or a time signature is changed, some lines may me moved beyond the last bar. These lines will still be saved, even though they are not visible. They can be restored by reversing the action that caused them to go beyond the last bar, or using the <b>Undo</b> <i>Button</i>.</p>
