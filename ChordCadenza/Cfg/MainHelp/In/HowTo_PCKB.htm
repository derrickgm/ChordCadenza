<h2>How To Play using the PC Keyboard</h2>

<p>If you don't have a Midi Keyboard, you can still play notes and chords using the PC Keyboard. This is not meant as a replacement for a Midi Keyboard, which is the preferred way of playing notes and chords.</p>

<p>The keyboard mappings should work with standard UK and US keyboards. If you have a different type of keyboard, you can try downloading a Virtual Midi Keyboard app that can be configured for your particular keyboard.</p>

<p>To activate the PC keyboard, you should select <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > Miscellaneous</b> to display the <b>Miscellaneous Configurations Window.</b> Then check the <b>PC Keyboard Active</b> <i>CheckBox</i> in the <b>General</b> panel. This will also activate the <b>Play Notes per Chord</b> <i>CheckBox</i>, and the <b>PCKBChar</b> <i>CheckBox</i> in the <b>Note Display</b> panel in the <b>PlayMap.</b></p>

<p>The bottom full row of keys on the keyboard (ZXCVBN) maps to the white keys in the bottom octave of the Midi Keyboard range.</p>

<p>The next row up (SDGHJ) maps to the black keys in the bottom octave.</p>

<p>The next row up (QWERTYUIOP) maps to the white keys in the next octave up (and beyond).</p>

<p>The next row up (2356790) maps to the black keys in the next octave up (and beyond).</p>

<p>Note that there are gaps in the black key mappings that correspond to positions on a Midi Keyboard that do not contain black keys.</p>

<p>Pressing a key will switch a note on, letting go switches it off. You can press more than one key at a time, however there is a limit to the number of simultaneous key presses that will be recognised by the system. This depends on which combination of keys are pressed and the  internal wiring of the keyboard. You can usually play at least 2 keys simultaneously.</p>

<p>The key velocity can be set using the <b>Velocity</b> <i>Numeric Input</i> on the <b>PlayMap</b>. The valid values are 1 to 127.</p>

<p>If the <b>Play Notes per Chord</b> <i>CheckBox</i> in the <b>Miscellaneous Configurations</b> Window is checked, this will allow you to play chords with a single key press. This is usually better than trying to play a chord with multiple key presses on a PC keyboard.</p>

<p>If the PC keyboard is active and a <span>Project</span> is loaded, the bottom line of the <b>PlayMap</b> display will show the alphanumeric character corresponding to the diatonic notes of the current musical key. If the <b>PCKBChar</b> <i>CheckBox</i> in the <b>Note Display</b> panel in the <b>PlayMap.</b> is also checked, the notes on the main display will also show the PC keyboard alphanumeric characters.</p>
