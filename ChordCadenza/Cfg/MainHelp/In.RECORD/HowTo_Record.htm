<h2>How To Record Midi Events</h2>

<p>You can record anything you play on your Midi Keyboard (or equivalent) to an existing midi track, or a new track.</p> 

<p>To create a new track, click on the <b>Add Track</b> <i>Button</i> in the <b>TrackMap.</b> This will create a new track at the bottom of the <b>TrackMap.</b> The new track will use a free Midi channel if one is available. It will also copy the Midi Patch (General Midi Instrument) from the Midi Keyboard Patch setting.</p>

<p>In order to enable recording, click on the <b>'R'</b> <i>Button</i> on a track in the <b>TrackMap.</b> This could be a new (empty) track, or an existing track. This will change the range of midi pitches displayed on that track to accommodate any pitches played from your Midi Keyboard. It will also redirect the Midi keyboard to the Midi Sequencer port. The Midi Keyboard channel, volume, pan, and patch will be controlled from the <b>TrackMap</b> track.</p>

<p>Recording will start when the <b>Play Midi</b> <i>Button</i> is clicked from the <b>TrackMap</b> (or <b>PlayMap</b> or <b>ChordMap</b>). The recorded events will be displayed on the track as they are played. After the midi play session is ended (either by clicking <b>Stop Play</b> or <b>Pause Play</b>, or when the end of the track is reached), you can save the midifile or undo the recording session.</p>

<p>Recorded events are always added to any existing events on the track. You can use the <b>Delete Notes</b> <i>Button</i> before the recording session to remove any notes that you don't want on the track.</p>
