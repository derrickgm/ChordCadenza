<h1>Sustain Types</h1>

<h3>Normal</h3>
  <p>Use the normal Midi Sustain function. This will send <b>Midi Sustain On/Off</b> messages in response to the sustain pedal or <b>SwitchKey</b>.</p>

<h3>Replay</h3>
  <p>Emulate sustain by leaving all chord notes switched on until the sustain pedal or <b>SwitchKey</b> is released, or a new chord is played.</p>
  <p>A chord is defined as any number of notes played within the time interval specified with the <b>Sustain</b> <i>Numeric Input</i> in this window.</p>

<h3>Carry Over</h3>
  <p>Same as <b>Replay</b>, but carries over any notes that are also in the next chord.</p>
  <p>This has the effect of making chord changes smoother for non-percussive instruments.</p>

<h3>Send Ctlr</h3>
  <p>Same as <b>Replay</b>, but uses <b>Midi Sustain On/Off</b> messages instead of <b>Midi Note On/Off</b> messages.</p>
  <p>It is recommended to only use this if you are having problems with the normal <b>Replay</b>.</p>
