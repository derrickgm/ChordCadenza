<h2>How To Choose a Type of Audio Synchronisation</h2>
<p>Instead of playing to a <b>MidiFile</b>, you can play to an audio source, which can be either an <b>AudioFile</b> (e.g. MP3) or a live stream.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you have to synchronize the midi data (chords) with the audio source. This can be done before playing the audio source (file synchronisation), or whilst it is being played (live synchronisation).</p>

<p>You can then play to the audio source in the same way as you would play to a <b>MidiFile</b>.</p>

<h3>Choosing File Synchronisation</h3>
<p>File Synchronisation is easier to set up and use, and is the preferred method by default. 

<p>The <b>AudioFile</b> is played by this program, and synchronisation is performed using the actual position in the file  (bytes).</p>
 
<h3>Choosing Live Synchronisation</h3>
<p>If you want to play to a live source, or a source that cannot be reproduced, you can use live synchronization.</p>

<p>This requires you to synchronize the midi data (chords) whilst the audio is being played.</p>
