<h2>SoundFont Files</h2>

<p>SoundFont files are located in the <a href="Configure_Paths.htm">SoundFont Path</a>. They have the extension <b>.sf2</b>, which is a standard extension for soundfont2 files.</p>

<p>This is used by the <b>BuiltIn Synth</b> function of this program. If you are not using this (because you are using your own midi synth), then there is no need to have these files present.</p>

<p>You can download these files from the internet. They are generally free, and can be quite large.</p>

<p>You may come across other soundfont formats (e.g. .sfz, .sfArk). These cannot be used in this program, but may be converted by a utility.</p>

<p>You can associate a soundfont with a midi output device using the <a href="Configure_MidiDevices.htm">Midi Devices Configuration Window.</a></p>
