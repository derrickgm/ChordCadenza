<h2>How To Generate Chords from a <b>MidiFile</b></h2>

<p>If you haven't already done so, load a <span>Project</span></p> 

<p>This should contain at least a <b>MidiFile</b> (*.mid) of the piece of music you want to generate the chords for.</p>

<h3>Open the ChordMap Window</h3>
<p>If a <b>ChordFile</b> is present, but empty, you should get a warning about there being no notes in the <b>ChordFile</b> - click <b>OK</b> and continue.</p>

<p>If the <b>ChordMap</b> window is not visible, click the <b>ChordMap</b> <i>Button</i> on the <b>PlayMap</b>.</p>

<p>This will open the <b>ChordMap</b> window that shows, in the Midi pane, all of the notes in the <b>MidiFile</b> condensed into one track (excluding percussion and pitchbent notes).</p>

<p>The <b>Chord Notes</b> pane shows any chords that are in the <b>ChordFile</b>. You can clear this by clicking the <b>Cut</b> <i>Button</i> at the the top of the window.</p>

<h3>Generate Chords</h3>
<p>There are many options in the <b>ChordMap</b> window, but for now you can just take the default options and click the <b>Generate Chords</b> <i>Button</i> near the top of the window.</p> 

<p>If you haven't generated or edited the keys yet, you should see a dialog asking whether you want to invoke <b>CalcKeys</b>. The keys are used by the chord generation algorithms. Unless you are sure the MidiFile keys are OK, you should select one of the <b>CalcKeys</b> options and then click <b>Apply and Close</b> from the <b>CalcKeys</b> window. More information about <b>CalcKeys</b> can be found <a href="Form_CalcKeys_Intro.htm">here</a></p>

<p>This will generate the chords for the whole <b>MidiFile</b>, which will be displayed in the <b>Chord Notes</b> pane. The names of the chords will also be displayed in the text boxes near the bottom of the window.</p>

<h3>Save Keys and Chords to a <b>ChordFile</b></h3>
<p>Click the <b>Save Chords As...</b> or <b>Save Project</b> <i>Button</i> to save the chords in the <b>ChordFile</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>ChordFile</b> (.chp0) will be saved in the same directory as the <b>MidiFile</b> (.mid).</p>

<p>It contains information about the chords and keys, as well as some miscellaneous information. It is the main file that is used by the program alongside a <b>MidiFile</b>.</p>

<p>It can be read or edited by a text file editor like Notepad, although manually editing the file is generally not recommended.</p>

<h3>Further Information</h3>
