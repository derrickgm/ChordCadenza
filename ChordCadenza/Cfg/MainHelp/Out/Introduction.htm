<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Chord Cadenza is an application that helps you to play along with a midifile or audiofile. It allows you to improvise with a midi keyboard, even if you have only limited or no midi keyboard skills.</p>

<p>It comes complete with a midifile sequencer to play, and manage midifile tracks. It also has an builtin synthesizer, and facilities for generating chords and keys from a midifile.</p>

<p>The main functions of the program are found in the <b>PlayMap</b>, <b>TrackMap</b>, and <b>ChordMap</b> windows.</p>

<p>The <b>PlayMap</b> displays chords that have been generated in a way that makes it easy to play with a midi keyboard. The display is updated as a midifile (or audiofile) is played.</p>

<p>The <b>TrackMap</b> shows the tracks of a midifile in a sequencer-type of display, with functions for muting, soloing, changing volume, pan, and midi instrument  patches.</p>

<p>The <b>ChordMap</b> is used to generate and display chords. You can also edit chords, midi time signatures, and keys from here.</p>

<p>Sounds can be rendered using the builtin synthesizer, or a stand-alone midi synthesizer.</p>

<p>There are also windows for calculating keys from midifile tracks, creating and editing lyrics, and managing audiofile playback and synchronisation.</p>
