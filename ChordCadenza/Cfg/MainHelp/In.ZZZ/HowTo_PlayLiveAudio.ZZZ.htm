<h2>How To Play along with Live Audio</h2>

<p>You can play along to a live audio stream without synchronising the midi data (chords) beforehand. This could be an internet audio stream, or an audio file played with an external player, or even a live group.</p>

<p>This requires you to use a <b>SwitchKey</b> to move forward to the next beat or chord whilst playing the chords.</p>

<h3>Setup the <b>SwitchKeys</b></h3>
<p>Go to <b>PlayMap Menu > Configure > <b>SwitchKeys</b>/Pedal.</b> </p>

<p>Set the <b>NextEvent</b> dropdown box to a <b>SwitchKey</b> or Pedal.</p>
 
<h3>Setup the Sync Event</h3>
<p>You will need to decide what type of event you want to synchronise - beats or chords.</p>

<p>Generally, using beats is easier, and is similar to the other sync methods. </p>

<p>However, you can use chord synchronisation as an alternative. This will allow you to play chords on a different beat to the default.</p>

<p>To set the event type, go to the Miscellaneous Config window <b>(PlayMap Menu > Configure > Miscellaneous)</b> and select <b>Next Beat</b> or <b>Next Chord</b> in the <b>Live Audio Sync Event</b> panel.</p>

<h3>Load a <span>Project</span> and Play</h3>
<p>You will need to load a <span>Project</span> containing a <b>ChordFile</b> that matches the audio that you want to play along to. </p>
 
<p>You should then set the current cursor to the bar you want to start playing at (cue point).</p>

<p>Start playing the audio stream on an external player. When it reaches the cue point, hit the <b>SwitchKey</b> (<b>Next Event</b>).</p>

<p>You can now play the first chord from the cue point. </p>

<p>Continue hitting the <b>SwitchKey</b> when the next chord or beat is reached, whilst playing the chords.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if the chord is played just before or after a <b>SwitchKey</b>, as it will be ready to locate to the chord after the previous <b>SwitchKey</b> is released.</p>

<p>Chords will only play if the <b>SwitchKey</b> is pressed down. If you are playing chords or a slow song, make sure you don't release the <b>SwitchKey</b> too early!</p>
