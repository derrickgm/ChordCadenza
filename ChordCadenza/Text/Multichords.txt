MULTICHORDS
-----------

allow for choice from list of chords at any one time
assume all chords start and end on a beat boundary

create from
  chord generation 
    top (4) chords, within a score or aggscore range
  manual addition

play
  new option checked 
    only in keyboard mode and KBChord switched on
    or chordmode???

  constant number of notes in chord (nud)
    3 or 4
    use diff between top and bottom to determine which chord is played
      min diff = first chord
    no need to wait for timeout, just wait for last note to be played

edit
  remove chords that are no good
  add new chord
