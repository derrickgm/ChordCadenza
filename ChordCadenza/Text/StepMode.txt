STEPMODE
--------

play track whilst playing rest of midifile

like KeyboardMode, except:
  input from one midi track 
    instead of ChordFile
  always play whole chord with single keypress 
    like 'Play Notes per Chord' option on frmStart
  move forward to next chord after playing (Midi ON)
    instead of using chord time/syncopation
    allows for some overlap
    white note - play next chord
    black note - skip next chord?
  record midi ON and OFF times
  reposition if more than (nn/dd note) out, and another chord is nearer midi ON time
  display
    frmSC 'Show Tracks'
  record
    number of events should not change
    extract track to 2/3 recording tracks - ON, OFF, CC
    adjust timings & velocities during record
      if not in order, adjust timing to keep in order!
    save midifile
      exclude original track
      include ON, OFF, CC recording tracks
  punch in/out
    start at nearest first ON ev in a bar
    end anywhere
  continuous controllers (pitchebend)
    exclude from original track
    maybe include on 3rd new recording track (CC)
