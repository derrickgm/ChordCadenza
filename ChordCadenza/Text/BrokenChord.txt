    single chord may span multiple bars
  parameter
    brokenchordtrack
      only one track allowed - manually mute any other tracks that get in the way
      (mute automatically during brokenchord)
  
class clsBrokenChord
  play using beat as delimiter
    use midioutKB (not midioutstream) 
    subchord = note or chord within the broken beat
  keep track of which chordnotes are currently sounding 
  APlayOn(pitch) 
    play if chordnote not already sounding and 
      kb key is down
      or beat sustained
    don't play non-chord notes 
  APlayOff(pitch)

    play as in file if root position played 
    double up if same note played at different octaves
    treble up to switch same pitch classes
  Pitch mode absolute

    doubles - default upwards arpeggio
    treble up to go down arpeggio
